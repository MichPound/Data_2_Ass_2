# Datastructures_2_Assignment_2
Route finder based in Rome

This team assignment was done with Dimitri: https://github.com/dimakis

The aim of this assignment was to make a system to find the different routes between locations around the city of Rome.
Once two locations have been selected either from the list of locations stored or just from clicking on the map the route between the locations is found. 
There is multiple options for finding the route including Dijstras, BFS, DFS and a few others, the route is then displayed on the map. The user can choose from the locations stored if they want to include a specific locations or avoid a specific location.

In the second tab in the system locations can be added by pointer or precise coordinates, landmarks can also be removed from the system here. When adding landmarks cost can also be added between the new landmark and already existing ones.
